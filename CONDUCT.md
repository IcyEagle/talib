# Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive,
and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the Talib
project. It is derived from the Ruby Code of Conduct.

It applies to all “collaborative space”, which is defined as community
communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches,
commit comments, etcetera).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions
are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others,
participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered
harassment will not be tolerated.

Whenever this CoC is violated, please [contact](contact@wuhkuh.com) the project
owner.
